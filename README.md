# Spotify Podcast Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

## Description
This project is a local Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed for Spotify podcasts. It fetches episode names and descriptions from the Spotify API, processes them using the OpenAI API (mainly for translation), generates embeddings, and allows users to query the local LLM. The Streamlit interface lets users compare query results when using RAG versus not using it, providing insights into the effectiveness of retrieval-augmented responses.
